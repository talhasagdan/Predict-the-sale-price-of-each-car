# Predict the sale price of each car in Python 3 with Jupyter Notebook

This project is mainly about the prediction of the sale price of the each car with using machine learning techniques in python 3. This include creating, analysing and generating predictions with regression models.
You also need following packages:

__-sklearn
  -pandas
  -mathplotlib
  -numpy__
  
  
__Data Set:__

The data set contains information on many different car types and their prices. This project challenges you to predict the sale price of each car. Data is in CSV format and has already been split into training and test sets for your convenience: 

__train.csv: the training set__

__test.csv: the test set.__
